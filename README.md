# Algorithms and Data Structures

Algo is a small college project containing a few algorithms and data structures. <br />
Templates were given by my professor and we had to complete them while some algorithms were already coded as examples. <br />
It is written in python and is meant to be used as a reference for future projects.

## LeetCode
My LeetCode solutions are also included in this repository. <br />

## Getting Started

You can just create a new project venv and you are good to go.

### Prerequisites

* Python3 (Any version above 3.6 should work)
* An IDE or code editor of your choice! (I recommend PyCharm or VSCode)

### Heads Up
If you want to debug the code, you will need to temporarily delete the `Queue` folder.
